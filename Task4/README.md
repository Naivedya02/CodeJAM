The data of the students is present in students.json file.
Looping over that data file on the basis of blood type, I made lists of names for all different blood types.
Depending on the blood group entred in GUI window, the lists are concatenated accordingly to create the recipients' list.
The mail is then sent to all the recipients. Username and password fields are not filled correctly in the code.
Alternate to sending mails, you can also obtain all the names by clicking the Get Names button in the GUI.
